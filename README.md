# Portfolio Optimization Under Constraints â€“ Financial Analytics

This project investigates the performance of three portfolio optimization strategies under different investment constraints using historical equity return data from the Ken French Data Library (30 sector industries). Specifically, it compares:

- MV (Unconstrained Mean-Variance Optimization)
- NSMV (No-Shorting Constraint)
- MIMV (Minimum Investment Constraint per Asset)

Both in-sample and out-of-sample evaluations are conducted by estimating mean and covariance matrices of returns over a rolling window. Python was used to implement the models and calculate risk-return trade-offs across all strategies, with findings visualized via tables and mean-standard deviation plots. The analysis provides practical insight into how real-world constraints impact the efficiency of optimal portfolios.
